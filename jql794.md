Hello, my name is Tanner Wilkey. I am a junior computer science major. My programming background is almost exclusively in c++. I have also worked a little bit with jave. 
I am pretty open to any project idea, but my personal interests would be something financial related or data analysis. I also think designing an app or even something more
on the front end side of things could be exciting as well.
