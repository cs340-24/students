I am Vedaant Patel and I am a computer science student at UTK. I am from Collierville, TN and also lived in Chicago, IL for a large part of my childhood.
I love sports and played football in high school and I currently work for the Vols baseball team in an Analytics and Scouting Role. I am excited to work
with others and hopefully create a pretty cool project.
