I am Frank Standaert, a math/computer science double major. My background
consists of college courses and nothing else worthy of remark. I am interested
in many topics in both math and computer science, but I find the combination
especially of the two especially interesting. For instance, I am currently
enjoying my numerical analysis and linear algebra class quite a lot.
