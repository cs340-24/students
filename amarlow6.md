I am Jake Marlow and I am a junior of Comp Sci at UTK. I am from Houston, TX love to listen to music and go skateboarding with my friends. I became interested in computers in highschool and decided to change my major to comp sci freshman year of college. I currently work for Technology for Energy Corp in Knoxville, TN doing front end developement and I really enjoy it.
