I am Jackson Dodd and I am junior pursuing a Computer Science degree. I have experience from
my co-op with Siemens Medical Solutions, and I love to play drums in my free time. I like coding and  
am interested in learning more about data science, cybersecurity, and front end web development.
I am looking forward to learning practical skills from this course.
