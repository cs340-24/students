My name's Will Winslade, I'm currently a 4th year undergrad and a 3rd year compsci major after switching in from BME.
I have little professional experience with software engineering, but I am excited to get some hands on experience thru this class. I currently work part time for Knoxville Utilities Board as a network engineering intern, so I'm excited to get out of the network layers and
into the application layers of tech.

I'm very curious about game design and engineering, iOS development, and ML. Looking forward to taking this class!
