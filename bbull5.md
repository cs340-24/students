My name is Brandon Bull. I'm currently an intern at a legaltech startup where I primarily work on using LLMs to add generative AI capabilities to the company's current products. My current project is developing a guardrails system to our chatbot to prevent exploitation and adversarial prompting. I am competent with C and C++ and experienced in Python.

My interests are mainly in continuing down the generative AI path. For example, using LLMs to develop individualized educational tools. I also have an interest in gaining experience with a more modern language, particularly Go.
