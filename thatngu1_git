Both github fork and clone creates a copy of the prokect you're working on.
When you do a fork, it will create a copy on the remote (like github.com),
When you clone, it creates a copy to your local system.
A github branch is useful tool for when working with multiple people at the same time.
"Creating branches" helps branch off to work on your own part of the project, while it doesn't
affect others works and doesn't affect your project history.

It is ideal to merge your branch with the master branch after to complete your collaboration with others.
