I'm Daniel Mallett. I'm passionate about computer science and software engineering.
I also have a background in mechanical engineering. I have some experience developing 
web apps for UT and enjoy doing undergraduate research with TENNLab. I'm really looking
forward to this course and having the chance to collaborate with a team on building
something really cool.
