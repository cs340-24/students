netid: slavey

My name is Sam LaVey and I am a junior undergrad student here at UTK.
I am interested in cybersecurity, both red-teaming and blue-teaming, as well as
DevSecOps. I have worked for several companies as an intern, and am currently
working as a software engineering intern for a fintech company based in New Jersey.
