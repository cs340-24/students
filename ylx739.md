Hello, I am Ian Burns, a junior here at The University of Tennessee. I am a computer engineering major, and look 
forward to graduating in 2025. I am interested in the fields of software engineering, hardware engineering and 
AI/machine learning, among others. Outside of my academics, I like playing and watching soccer, as well as
watching our Tennessee Volunteers.
