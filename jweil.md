Hi, I'm Jackson Weil. I am currently a junior CS major. My intellectual / academic curiosity has always been piqued by
the field of mathematics, especially in worldly phenomena / problems that might be modeled mathematically. Recently, I
have been keenly interested in deep learning - I believe this field has shown the power of mathematics in a way that
appears, at first glance, to be utter magic - and I believe we've only seen the tip of this iceberg. As for the
purposes of this class, I am quite flexible currently in my final project aspirations --- I would love to work at
the intersection of web dev and data science. Cheers.
